# Billy Chat

## Description

This project features a chatbot that provides information about class schedules and related data. It is built with React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. It interacts with OpenAI's GPT-4 API to process user queries and respond with relevant information.

### Frontend
The React-based frontend has a user-friendly chat interface, with custom visual elements and a system for handling user input. Users can interact with the chatbot to ask about class schedules, instructors, or other class-related details.

- Customizable chat UI with interactive elements.
- Backend endpoint to retrieve class information.
- Error handling and typing indicators for a smooth user experience.
